/*
//hasOwnProperty():
The hasOwnProperty() method returns a boolean indicating whether the
object has the specified property as its own property (as opposed to inheriting it).
//
This method can be used to determine whether an object has the specified property as a direct property of that object; unlike the in operator, this method does not check for a property in the object's prototype chain. If an Object is an Array, hasOwnProperty  method can check whether an index exists.
//in:
The in operator returns true if the specified property is in the specified object or its prototype chain.+.
